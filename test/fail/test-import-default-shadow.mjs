// Legal ECMA. The global namespace contains the property process. The import should effectively create
// a variable named process in the current scope. Jerryscript throws an Error that the export shadows a
// local variable. This import pattern works fine in NodeJS.

// Note: "import somethingElse from 'node:process'" works as expected

import process from 'node:process'
